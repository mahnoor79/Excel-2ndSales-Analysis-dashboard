**💡 Key Insights from the Dashboard**    

**1) ✅ High Sales ≠ High Profit**
 "HON 5400 Series Task Chairs" generated ₹21,870.58 in sales but almost zero profit (₹0).
💡 This shows that not all high-selling products are profitable, often due to large discounts.

**2) 📦 Top-selling categories**
**Technology:** ₹836,154.03 (📈 Highest)
**Furniture:** ₹741,999.80
**Office Supplies:** ₹719,047.03
💡 Technology products brought in the most sales overall.

**3)🚚 Shipping Impact**
Standard Class (Most Used): ₹1,358,216.00 sales | ₹164,088.79 profit
Same Day: ₹128,363.10 sales | ₹15,891.76 profit
💡 Although "Standard Class" was used most often, profit margins were not always better compared to faster modes like "First Class" or "Second Class".

**4) 🌍 Regional Trends**
West: ₹725,457.82 sales | ₹108,418.45 profit (📊 Top Region)
South: ₹391,721.91 sales | ₹46,749.43 profit (📉 Lowest)
💡 The West region performed the best in both sales and profit. South had the weakest performance.

**5)👥 Segment-wise Performance**

Consumer Segment: 

₹1,161,401.00 sales | ₹134,119.21 profit (📊 Most sales)
Corporate Segment:

₹706,146.40 sales |

₹91,979.13 profit |
